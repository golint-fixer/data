MemStore

A MemStore provides in-memory key:value cache that expires after defined
duration of time. That duration is defined when a new instance is initialized
calling 'data.NewCacheStore()' or 'data.NewTransientStore()' function and it is
used to all new stored values.

The MemStore can manage an application context. Creating an application context
its the recommended way to avoid global variables and strict the access to your
variables to selected functions.

The lifetime for new values and existing values can be modified calling
'SetLifetime()'. The new expiration time will be automatically updated when
its value is retrieved by the following methods: 'Add()', 'Get()' and 'Set()'.
